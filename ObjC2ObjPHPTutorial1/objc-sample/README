This directory contains the complete code for the "Simple Sample Objective-C
program" described in the comp.lang.objective-c FAQ.  If you have a suitable
compiler, use the supplied Makefile.  Otherwise, program output can be found
in the file "output".

You should probably read "main.m" first.  It is very heavily annotated.

Also note and read the file COPYRIGHT.
